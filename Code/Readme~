-Before running the code create a file with all classes written in it.
Ex- iris_classes.dat file contain names of the classes like Iris-setosa,etc in each line. 

-Once the classes file is written run the code run_knn.m using the parameters.

run_knn(dataset , size , training_set_size ,k, no_of_attributes ,no_of_classes ,classifier_index ,classes_file, iterations , kfold_flag)

dataset - dataset on which we wish to run the code. Ex- iris.dat

size - Dataset size

training_set_size - send the training set size for the approach. Ex - 50% size in random subsampling approach

k - number of nearest neighbours for k-nn classifier i.e k =1 or k=3 .

no_of_attributes - Number of attributes the data point has. ( Excluding class attribute )

no_of_classes - Number of classes.

classifier_index - index of the classifier attribute in the data point.

classes_file - The file which contains the names of all classes. 

iterations - No of times we wish to run the code.

kfold_flag - kfold_flag == 1 => Uses 5-fold cross validation approach  
             kfold_flag == 0 => Uses random sampling approach
