# K-Nearest-Neighbours
-Implented the K-NN classifier for k=1 and k=3
- Choosen 3 datasets for evaluation of classifier.
- Dataset -1 : Iris dataset - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris
- Dataset -2 : Seeds dataset - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds
- Dataset -3: Haberman dataset - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Haberman's+Survival

I have seeds, haberman dataset because these datasets as compared with iris dataset has last attribute as classifier attribute. so that it would be easy to evaluate the code for k-nn classifier by making small changes in the code.
